## How To Use

Enter a value for both the Longitude and Latitude box options. You can
re-position yourself on the map by dragging the icon to another position.
Click on points around the map where you supposedly need to drop off
deliveries, the app will automatically calculate and showcase the best
route to take based on time efficiency.
